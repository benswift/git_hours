# GitHours

An elixir port of [GitHours](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours), or at
least something close to it conceptually.

## Usage

Run this script in a git repository to get a summary of the time you've spent.

Currently the UX is super-basic; just change the `GitHours.calculate/1` call at
the bottom of the file.

## TODO

Add more features... maybe? But honestly this is just to scratch an itch. So no
timeline on if (or when) I'll get to it.
